# Handling Resources List in JWT

---

### 1️⃣ Handling Missing Resources List

* If the resources list is absent in the token, always **check for null or empty** before iterating.
* Most JWT libraries (Java: `io.jsonwebtoken`, `nimbus-jose-jwt`) will **return null** or a missing claim, they **won’t throw an exception** just for a missing claim.

**Example:**

```java
List<String> allowedResources = jwtService.getClaim(token, "resources");
if (allowedResources != null) {
    // check access using token
} else {
    // fallback to DB/cache lookup
}
✅ No exception occurs as long as null is handled properly.

2️⃣ Proposed Flow
Token issuance:

Count allowed resources for account/client.

If ≤ 100 → embed resource IDs + actions in JWT claims

If > 100 → skip embedding, leave claim null

Access check:

Extract resource list from token

If present → check access statelessly

If null → query DB or cache for allowed resources → check access

3️⃣ Why This Approach is Good / Standard-Aligned
Aspect	How It Aligns With Best Practices
Stateless JWT validation	When resource list is in token → no DB hit ✅
Scalable fallback	When resource list is too big → query DB/cache ✅
Token size control	Avoids very large JWTs → prevents HTTP header issues ✅
ABAC-friendly	Token can carry resourceId:action → fine-grained access ✅
Standard pattern	Keycloak/Okta use similar hybrid: include scopes/roles in token + DB/PDP ✅

4️⃣ Notes / Minor Recommendations
Use a separate claim for resources, e.g., "resources" → array of {id, action}

Cache DB lookups if fallback happens frequently → improves performance

Consider token refresh → if resource list grows above threshold, next refresh can include or skip

Always validate signature, exp, iss, aud before using claims

✅ Conclusion
Safe and scalable

Follows OAuth2/OIDC + JWT best practices

Matches mature IAM systems (Keycloak/Okta hybrid: scopes in token + DB/cache)
