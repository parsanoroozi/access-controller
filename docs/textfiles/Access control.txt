Ah, now I understand exactly what you’re doing — and this is actually a good direction. Let me break it down clearly.

1️⃣ Issue #5 recap

Problem in your current implementation:

account.getRole().getResources()
       .stream()
       .map(Resource::getName)
       .anyMatch(name -> name.equals(request.getResourceName()));


You’re only checking resource name, ignoring:

Action (read, write, admin)

Resource type (api-endpoint, web-page)

Context/environment (time, IP, tenant, etc.)

This is brittle → any small change in resource naming breaks authorization.

Also, this is coarse RBAC, not ABAC or policy-based.

2️⃣ What you are doing now

From what you described:

Clients: define their resources when they register (resource.name, type, url, action).

Roles: have a list of resources.

Accounts: belong to a role.

So now account.role.resources has objects like:

{
  id: 123,
  name: "invoice",
  type: "api-endpoint",
  url: "/invoices",
  action: "read"
}


This is already much richer than just string matching. You can check:

resource.getName().equals(requestedResourceName) &&
resource.getAction().equals(requestedAction)

3️⃣ How this aligns with best practices

Scope-based: In OAuth2, tokens often include permissions like invoice:read, invoice:write. ✅

You can generate a scope claim in JWT for the role’s allowed actions.

ABAC/Policy-based: Keycloak, Okta, OPA/Rego, Cedar: evaluate access using attributes:

Subject → user role, groups, tenant

Resource → type, owner, url, action

Environment → time, IP, device
✅ You’re basically implementing ABAC at the role/resource level.

4️⃣ Concrete improvements
a) Simple ABAC

Request should include:

{
  "resourceName": "invoice",
  "resourceAction": "read"
}


Authorization check:

boolean allowed = account.getRole().getResources().stream()
    .anyMatch(r -> r.getName().equals(request.getResourceName())
               && r.getAction().equals(request.getAction()));


Optional: include type and/or url for finer-grained checks.

✅ This avoids brittle string-only checks and introduces action-aware checks.

b) Using JWT scopes (optional optimization)

Instead of querying DB for every request, encode allowed actions in token:

"scope": ["invoice:read", "invoice:write", "user:update"]


Then the API can just check if requestedResource:requestedAction is in the scope claim.

This reduces DB/cache lookups and makes your resource servers stateless.

c) Policy-based ABAC (advanced)

Implement a PDP (Policy Decision Point) like OPA/Rego or Cedar:

allow if:
  user.role in resource.allowedRoles
  AND resource.type = requestedType
  AND resource.action = requestedAction
  AND env.ip in allowedIps
  AND env.time within officeHours


Your current Client → Resources → Role → Account structure is perfect for feeding a PDP.

5️⃣ My opinion on your architecture

Pros:

You are already modeling resources as objects with action, type, url → this is ABAC-ready.

Roles aggregate resources → fine-grained RBAC → can generate scopes for tokens.

Clients register resources → supports multi-tenant authorization.

Potential improvements:

Encode permissions/scopes into JWT when issuing tokens → stateless access checks.

Consider caching resource mappings (role → resources) for high-performance checks.

If you want environment/context-aware access, move to policy engine (OPA/Rego/Cedar).

Avoid using resource.name only → always match name + action (+ optional type/url).

✅ Bottom line:
Your architecture is good and aligns with modern IAM patterns. You’re effectively building ABAC over RBAC, which is what Keycloak and Okta do internally.
The main “missing piece” is either:

Encoding scopes in tokens for stateless checks

Or a PDP for dynamic, context-aware policies

If you want, I can rewrite your checkAccess method using action-aware resource matching and scope-based JWT checks, showing a clean ABAC approach similar to Keycloak/Okta.

Do you want me to do that?
