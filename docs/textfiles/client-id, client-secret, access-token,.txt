1. Client ID vs Client Secret

Client ID ‚Üí a public identifier for the app.

Example: "my-mobile-app"

It‚Äôs okay if this leaks ‚Äî it just tells you which app is calling.

Client Secret ‚Üí a password your IAM generates when the app registers.

Example: "Xyz123$SuperSecret"

Used only by confidential clients (e.g., backend apps).

Never embedded in mobile apps or SPAs (those are public clients).

So:

Client registers with IAM ‚Üí IAM stores client_id and client_secret.

The client will later use those only when exchanging for tokens (not for every request).

2. When does the client send the secret?
a) Client Registration (once)

When you first register a client in IAM, you generate:

client_id (stored in DB)

client_secret (given to the client, store hashed like a password)

This is a one-time setup step.

b) Token Request (ongoing)

When the client asks IAM for an access token (via /token endpoint), it proves its identity with client_id + client_secret.

Example:

POST /token
Authorization: Basic base64(client_id:client_secret)
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&code=abc123&redirect_uri=https://myapp/callback


Authorization header is the best practice.

Body parameters (client_id + client_secret) are allowed but less secure.

3. Who authenticates who?

This is where roles separate:

IAM authenticates clients ‚Üí via client_id + client_secret (or mTLS, JWT assertion).

IAM authenticates users (accounts) ‚Üí via username/password, biometrics, social login, etc.

üëâ Both authentications happen only at the authorization server (your IAM).

4. Who gives tokens?

Only the IAM‚Äôs token endpoint (/token) issues tokens:

Access Token ‚Üí short-lived (5‚Äì15 minutes), used to call APIs.

Refresh Token ‚Üí longer-lived, used to get new access tokens.

Not during login. Not during checkAccess. Not during account registration.
Only at /token.

So:

When a client app logs in a user:

Client redirects user to IAM (/authorize) ‚Üí IAM authenticates user.

IAM returns an authorization code to the client.

Client calls /token with client_id + client_secret + code.

IAM issues access token + refresh token.

5. Resource Access Flow (tying it together)

Client registers ‚Üí gets client_id + client_secret.

User logs in through client ‚Üí IAM issues access token (and refresh token).

Client calls APIs with Authorization: Bearer <access_token>.

Resource server (your IAM‚Äôs checkAccess or API Gateway):

Validates the token.

Reads sub (user) + client_id (app).

Applies authorization policies.

Returns ‚Äúallowed‚Äù or ‚Äúdenied‚Äù.

6. Back to your confusion

‚Äúso its not its job for authentication (for clients account) and registration of the clients account to give client an access token and refresh token in return?‚Äù

User authentication (username/password, biometrics, etc.) is IAM‚Äôs job, but tokens are only handed out at /token.

Client authentication (with secret) happens when asking /token, not on every API call.

Client registration is usually a manual/admin operation (sometimes dynamic registration exists). It‚Äôs not the same as logging in.

‚úÖ Key takeaway:

client_id = public name of the app (in DB, in token).

client_secret = private password for the app (used only when exchanging for tokens, not on every API call).

access_token = proof of authentication/authorization, represents either a user or just the client, used on every API call.

refresh_token = long-lived, used only at /token to get new access tokens.

/token is the only place tokens are created/rotated.

Would it help if I draw you a sequence diagram (step by step arrows) showing how a user logs in through a client, how the client uses client_id + secret, and how the IAM issues tokens? That might clear up the flow visually.

üîë How client_id is assigned

In standard OAuth2/OIDC, the IAM generates the client_id.

It must be unique in your system, because it‚Äôs the identifier you‚Äôll later see inside tokens.

It‚Äôs usually a random string, not something human-friendly like "myApp".

Example (how Keycloak/Okta do it):

{
  "client_id": "c1c839f0-9aa2-4a21-9e42-98a6f9ffac3b",
  "client_secret": "jDk8sh2...."
}

üîë Why IAM generates it (not the client)

Prevents collisions (two clients accidentally picking the same ID).

Prevents guessable IDs (attackers shouldn‚Äôt predict IDs easily).

Keeps consistency with your DB (it‚Äôs basically the primary key for registered clients).


================================================
client registration:

1. What IAM stores in its DB (for each client)

At minimum, IAM must store enough to:

Identify the client

Authenticate the client (if confidential)

Control what it can do

‚úÖ Typical fields:

Field	Purpose
id (internal PK)	Your DB primary key
client_id	Public identifier (IAM-generated, unique)
client_secret_hash	Hashed secret (only for confidential clients)
name	Human-friendly name ("Mobile App", "CRM Backend")
type	public (mobile, SPA) or confidential (server app)
redirect_uris	Allowed callback URLs (for OAuth2 code flow)
grant_types	Which OAuth2 flows this client can use (authorization_code, client_credentials, refresh_token, etc.)
scopes	What scopes this client can request (openid, profile, read:invoices)
audience	Which resource servers the tokens can be used against
created_at / updated_at	Audit fields
status	Active / disabled

üîí Optional but recommended:

jwks_uri (if client uses its own key pair instead of secret)

allowed_cors_origins (for browser apps)

token_endpoint_auth_method (e.g. client_secret_basic, private_key_jwt, none)

2. What the client sends at registration endpoint

If you support Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591), the client fills out a JSON like this:

{
  "client_name": "My Mobile App",
  "redirect_uris": [
    "https://myapp.com/callback"
  ],
  "grant_types": [
    "authorization_code",
    "refresh_token"
  ],
  "response_types": ["code"],
  "scope": "openid profile read:invoices",
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic"
}


IAM then:

Validates it

Generates client_id (and client_secret if confidential)

Stores everything in DB

Returns a registration response:

{
  "client_id": "c1c839f0-9aa2-4a21-9e42-98a6f9ffac3b",
  "client_secret": "Xyz123$SuperSecret",   // show once!
  "client_name": "My Mobile App",
  "redirect_uris": ["https://myapp.com/callback"],
  "grant_types": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
  "scope": "openid profile read:invoices"
}

3. Admin-controlled registration (simpler approach)

If you don‚Äôt want open dynamic registration, you can:

Have admins create clients in your IAM dashboard.

Client only gets client_id and secret out-of-band (copy once).

This is what most production setups do (Keycloak/Okta):

Dynamic registration is optional, usually turned off unless you trust the environment.

‚úÖ TL;DR

DB must store: client_id, client_secret_hash, type, redirect URIs, grant types, scopes, etc.

Client provides at registration: name, redirect URIs, grant types, scopes, auth method.

IAM generates: client_id and client_secret.
