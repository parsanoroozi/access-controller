🏢 Multi-tenancy = multiple clients/companies using the same IAM
Example:


You host IAM for Company A and Company B.



Each has its own accounts, resources, and roles.


You must make sure no cross-leakage happens.


The points:
Row-level security or per-tenant schemas


When you store data in DB, make sure Company A cannot see Company B’s rows.


You can do this by:

Adding a tenant_id column and filtering every query (WHERE tenant_id = ?),


Or separating them into different schemas/databases.






👉 Like making sure each company has its own locked drawer.
