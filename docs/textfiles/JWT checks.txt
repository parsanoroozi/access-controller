🔹 What you’re doing now

You have jwtService.validateToken().

After that, you check the database for extra stuff (like user info, roles, etc.)

🔹 Why this matters

Right now you’re mixing:

Local JWT validation

Extra DB checks that are not always necessary

The standard way is:

JWT access token: validate locally (fast, no DB round-trip).

Opaque token: validate by calling IAM /introspect.


✅ Simple “Fix Checklist” for JWT validation

When validating JWTs, always check:

iss → Is it from your IAM?

aud → Is it really for your API?

exp / nbf / iat → Not expired, not used too early.

sub → The user ID/account.

client_id (if present) → Matches the registered client.

scope → Client has the right permissions.

alg + kid → Signature is correct, alg is safe, key is the right one.

jti → Track/revoke tokens if needed.

👉 So, in plain words:

If your IAM issues JWT tokens → you should only check the token itself (signature + claims), not the DB.

If your IAM issues opaque tokens → you must ask IAM via /introspect if the token is valid.



===========
1. JWTs are self-contained

When the IAM issues a JWT access token, it already embedded the truth inside it:

The sub = user/account ID (e.g., 123 or alice@example.com)

The client_id = the client who requested it

The scope = what this token can do

When your microservice (resource server) receives the JWT, it just:

Verifies the signature (to ensure IAM really issued it).

Verifies the claims (exp, iss, aud, etc.).

If those checks pass, then you already know:

This user was authenticated by IAM

This client is a registered one

The token is still valid and untampered

👉 That’s why you don’t need a DB lookup for every request.
The JWT itself is the guarantee.

2. But when would you need the DB?

You only hit your IAM DB in special cases:

First time login / registration (to authenticate user credentials or register a client)

When issuing the token (IAM itself looks up the user + client, then signs the JWT)

For revocation/blacklist (if you allow logout before expiry → check if jti is revoked)

For extra app data not inside the token (e.g., token says sub=123, but your API also needs the user’s profile picture → you’ll query your user DB, but that’s not for validation)

3. Why is this designed like that?

Because JWTs are meant to be stateless: the resource server doesn’t need to phone home to IAM or DB each time.

That’s what makes them fast and scalable in microservices.

🔑 How it should work with JWT

When IAM issues the access token, it should already have done this check:

✅ During /token request:

IAM verifies user credentials.

IAM verifies user belongs to that client (like in your snippet).

IAM embeds both sub (user/account ID) and client_id inside the JWT.

So later, when your resource server sees the token:

It doesn’t need to go to DB.

It just trusts: “IAM already confirmed this user belongs to that client when the token was minted.”
=========
BUT:::

(checking the resource belonging to the client) 
(checking the account has access to that resource)

these two needs the db (or cache) check and cannot get handled by the jwt simple checks...
