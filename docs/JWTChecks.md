# JWT Validation and DB Checks

---

### 🔹 What You’re Doing Now

* You have `jwtService.validateToken()`.
* After that, you check the database for extra info (user info, roles, etc.).

---

### 🔹 Why This Matters

Currently, you are mixing:

* Local JWT validation
* Extra DB checks that are not always necessary

**Standard approach:**

* **JWT access token** → validate locally (fast, no DB round-trip)
* **Opaque token** → validate by calling IAM `/introspect` endpoint

---

### ✅ Simple “Fix Checklist” for JWT Validation

When validating JWTs, always check:

* `iss` → Is it from your IAM?
* `aud` → Is it for your API?
* `exp` / `nbf` / `iat` → Not expired, not used too early
* `sub` → The user/account ID
* `client_id` (if present) → Matches the registered client
* `scope` → Client has the right permissions
* `alg` + `kid` → Signature is correct, algorithm is safe, key is correct
* `jti` → Track/revoke tokens if needed

**Plain words:**

* If your IAM issues **JWT tokens** → only check token itself (signature + claims), no DB lookup needed
* If your IAM issues **opaque tokens** → ask IAM `/introspect` to validate

### 1️⃣ JWTs Are Self-Contained

JWT access tokens embed the truth:

```text
sub = user/account ID (e.g., 123 or alice@example.com)
client_id = the client who requested it
scope = what this token can do
Resource server workflow:

Verify signature → ensure IAM issued the token

Verify claims → exp, iss, aud, etc.

If checks pass, you know:

The user was authenticated by IAM

The client is registered

Token is valid and untampered

No DB lookup required for validation. JWT itself guarantees authenticity.

2️⃣ When Would You Need the DB?
Only in special cases:

First-time login / registration → authenticate user or register client

When issuing the token → IAM looks up user + client before signing

Revocation / blacklist → e.g., logout before expiry → check jti

Extra application data not in token → e.g., profile picture, preferences

3️⃣ Why This Design?
JWTs are stateless → resource server doesn’t need to phone home to IAM or DB

Makes services fast and scalable in microservices

🔑 How It Should Work
During /token request:

IAM verifies user credentials

IAM verifies user belongs to that client

IAM embeds sub (user/account ID) and client_id in the JWT

Later, resource server sees token:

No DB check required for validation

Trusts that IAM confirmed the user belongs to the client when token was issued

⚠️ Exceptions: DB or Cache Checks Still Needed
Some checks cannot be fully embedded in JWT:

Check if resource belongs to client

Check if account has access to that resource

These require DB or cache lookups because they depend on dynamic data (roles, resources, permissions).

JWT alone is insufficient for these checks.
